# MongoDB Atlas Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Identified
The MongoDB connection is failing because **your current IP address is not whitelisted** in MongoDB Atlas.

## Error Message
```
Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted.
```

## Solution Steps

### 1. Whitelist Your IP Address in MongoDB Atlas

1. **Log into MongoDB Atlas**: Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. **Navigate to Network Access**:
   - Click on "Network Access" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Add IP Address"
3. **Add Current IP**:
   - Click "Add Current IP Address" (recommended)
   - Or manually add your IP address
   - Add a description like "Development Machine"
4. **For Development (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - You can temporarily add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow access from anywhere
   - **WARNING**: This is less secure, only use for development

### 2. Alternative: Use MongoDB Atlas Data API

If IP whitelisting continues to be problematic, we can implement the MongoDB Atlas Data API:

```javascript
// Alternative API-based approach
const ATLAS_DATA_API_URL = 'https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/data-xxxxx/endpoint/data/v1';
const atlasApiKey = process.env.MONGODB_ATLAS_KEY; // Set this in your environment variables

const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'api-key': atlasApiKey
};
```

### 3. Updated Connection Configuration

Once IP is whitelisted, use this simplified connection:

```javascript
// Simplified connection without deprecated options
await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 30000,
  socketTimeoutMS: 45000,
  family: 4 // Use IPv4
});
```

### 4. For Netlify Deployment

Netlify functions run from different IP addresses, so you'll need to:

1. **Option A**: Whitelist `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all IPs)
2. **Option B**: Use MongoDB Atlas Data API instead of direct connection
3. **Option C**: Use Netlify's static IP addresses (if available in your plan)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Whitelist your current IP in MongoDB Atlas
2. **Test**: Run the connection test again
3. **Deploy**: For production, consider using MongoDB Atlas Data API for better compatibility with serverless environments like Netlify
